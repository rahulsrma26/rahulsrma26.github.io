It also provides a free domain by the name of username.github.io. You can automate the deployment using GitHub Actions easily. In this article, we will learn how to deploy the site build by a static site generator named Gatsby.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## GitHub Pages\\n\\nGitHub Pages are public web pages hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/). It also provides a free domain `username.github.io`. For example, this site is hosted on `rahulsrma26.github.io` because my username is `rahulsrma26`.\\n\\nSteps to host using the free domain are:\\n\\n1. Create a repository named `username.github.io`\\n2. Put all the static web content including `index.html` in the `master` branch\\n\\nIf you face any difficulty following that then you can visit the official [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) site or [official guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).\\n\\nWhy do I choose a static site? Find it [here](/articles/static-site).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## GitHub Actions\\n\\n[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a feature provided by GitHub to automate workflow. A user can specify their workflow that can run on any GitHub event. It is a popular feature for CI/CD. A user can build, test, and deploy the code right from GitHub. More can be learned on Github [Action\'s site](https://github.com/features/actions).\\n\\nTo use actions you first need to create a directory\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir -p .github/workflows/\\n```\\n\\nA workflow can be specified using a YAML file in this directory.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Build and Deploy\\n\\nIf we want to use a static site generator that generates static pages from code/script (like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)). Then we need to save our code elsewhere. We can either save our code in a separate repository or in a separate branch. Since it\'s easier to manage a single repository, we can create a `dev` branch for all the code as the `master` branch is reserved for the deployment.\\n\\nTo create the workflow we can create `deploy.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory.\\n\\n```yml\\n# Name of the workflow\\nname: github pages deployment\\n\\n# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on\\n# push or pull request events but only for the dev branch\\non:\\n  push:\\n    branches: [ dev ]\\n  pull_request:\\n    branches: [ dev ]\\n\\n# Specifies what to run on the trigger\\njobs:\\n  deploy:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    steps:\\n    # first we need to checkout the repo\\n    # if dev brach is not the default branch\\n    # then you can specify the branch with \'ref\'\\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\\n    # then setup nodejs on the machine\\n    - uses: actions/setup-node@v1\\n      with:\\n        node-version: \'12\'\\n\\n    # then we need to install our static site generator\\n    - run: npm install -g gatsby-cli\\n    # doing clean install\\n    - run: npm ci\\n\\n    # Building the site (static web pages)\\n    - name: Gatsby Build\\n      run: gatsby build\\n\\n    # Copy all files from the build folder to the master branch\\n    - name: Deploy\\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\\n      with:\\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\\n        publish_dir: ./public\\n        publish_branch: master  # deploying branch\\n```\\n\\nThis will build and update your site whenever you push anything in the `dev` branch. If you want to restrict the deployment trigger on some specific files like `version.txt` or something like that, then you can modify the on push option.\\n\\n```yml\\non:\\n  push:\\n    paths:\\n    - \'**version.txt\'\\n```\\n\\nThis can be helpful in deploying a package to the hosting server. Like building and uploading a python package to a PyPI server, whenever there is a version update. I hope this article sheds some light on the capabilities of actions."},{"id":"love-letter","metadata":{"permalink":"/articles/love-letter","source":"@site/articles/2020-11-28-love-letter/index.md","title":"A love letter of a physicist","description":"Discover a humorous and creative love letter that blends physics with romance.

They can be deployed using static servers like Netlify, Github, etc. So, they are much more secured and require very little maintenance. Gatsby is a React based open-source framework that can be used to create static sites.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## History\\n\\nI have created my first website in 2011 using vanilla HTML and CSS. Then I wanted to have a blog on my site as well. Around 2014, I ported my site to [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/). It was great for the time and it supports markdown for blog writing. But, I was using a pug template engine with coffee-script in the mix, which proves difficult to use and modify for me. Also, Wintersmith\'s was not in active development. I wanted to have full control of my template engine using javascript only. As I have a decent understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org/), I was looking for a static site generator that is React based. Then I found [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) which was open-source and based on React. It also has a very active development community and a plethora of plugins.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why static site?\\n\\nA good practice is don\'t go for a dynamic website unless need to. Some of the advantages are:\\n\\n1. Speed\\n\\n    Since, we are just hosting and serving static files, when the user visits a page, all the web server has to do is to return a file. No server-side code is executed. With good caching policies and using CDNs, nothing can match the serving speed of a static site.\\n\\n2. Security\\n\\n    As there\u2019s no server-side processing (back-end/database) involved, the threat of code injection is minimal for a static website.\\n\\n3. Reliability\\n\\n    It\'s very unlikely that something can go wrong in Serving just basic HTML files. However, in the case of a dynamic site, it may crash or goes down because of a server/database error.\\n\\n4. Hosting\\n\\n    Usually, it\'s cheaper to host static websites. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Fast.io](https://fast.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) are some of the popular choices.\\n\\n5. Scalability\\n\\n    Handling massive traffic on a dynamic website might not be as easy, as it requires complex code running on the server. Host a static website on a Cloud provider with auto-scaling and we are good to go. You can also use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to geographically cache your static files and the calls to your web server will be drastically reduced. Also, no  database scaling will be required.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Using Gatsby\\n\\nTo use gatsby you will first need [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). After that Gatsby can be installed using npm.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install -g gatsby-cli\\n```\\n\\nThe above command will install Gatsby CLI globally on your machine. It is used to perform common functionality, such as creating a Gatsby application based on a starter, spinning up a hot-reloading local development server, and more!\\n\\nNow, you can use gatsby-cli to create a new react starter site for gatsby. There are plenty of starter/boilerplate projects available on the [gatsby-starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/) section. We are using a simple blog boilerplate code.\\n\\n```bash\\ngatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\\ncd my-blog\\n```\\n\\nThis will create a new project dir. The code structure is very similar to the react app.\\n\\n```txt\\n.\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 content\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 blog\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 gatsby-browser.js\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 gatsby-config.js\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 gatsby-node.js\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 node_modules\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 components\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 normalize.css\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 pages\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 style.css\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 static\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 favicon.ico\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 robots.txt\\n```\\n\\nYou can now start a development server. All the changes in the code will be reflected on the server in realtime.\\n\\n```bash\\ngasby develop\\n```\\n\\nYou can visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to check your development server.\\n\\n![starter-blog](starter-blog.png)\\n\\nTo deploy the site you first need to build the static pages using the build command.\\n\\n```bash\\ngatsby build\\n```\\n\\nThis will generate the static site in the `public` directory. A local server can be used to test the generated site.\\n\\n```bash\\ngatsby serve\\n```\\n\\n## Start blogging\\n\\nThe home page can be changed by editing `src/pages/index.js` file. And you can add/remove blog posts from `content/blog` directory. Gatsby is not limited to just a blog type site. You can create almost any static-site imaginable with it. Visit [gatsbyjs.com/showcase](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/showcase/) to see all the different types of sites that others have built.\\n\\nThis site is build using Gatsby.\\n\\nHappy Coding!"},{"id":"pride-and-patience","metadata":{"permalink":"/articles/pride-and-patience","source":"@site/articles/2018-06-12-pride-and-patience/index.md","title":"Pride & Patience (dragonball z painting)","description":"Explore the creative process behind a stunning Dragon Ball Z-inspired digital painting.

Weather has been changed from sunny (in the original series) to thunderstorm to suit the mood.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis article contains my thought process behind this painting. Characters belong to\\n[Dragon Ball Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z) universe and painting is done in\\n[Krita](https://krita.org/en/).\\n\\n## Final painting\\n\\n![highlights](pp06.jpg)\\n\\n[Deviantart link](https://rahulsrma26.deviantart.com/art/24-Pride-And-Patience-748779649)\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis painting is inspired from\\n![original](ref.jpg)\\n\\nThis scene is from one of my favorite saga (android saga) from the show Dragon Ball Z. This is where Vegeta and other Z warriors lose to androids and they just find out that there is an even more powerful villain (cell). Vegeta just goes to the mountains and Trunks follows. Later, Goku arrives and Trunks informs Goku that Vegeta is standing there from the last three days. It\'s a sunny day with a clear sky in the show, which in my opinion doesn\'t suit the mood. So, to bring justice to the scene, I\'ve altered the weather and time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step I - Sketch\\n\\n![sketch](pp00.jpg)\\n\\nI start most of my paintings with a sketch. It gives me an idea regarding size, proportion, perspective, and the space around characters.\\nThis process is easier to perform but a lot of thought process and tinkering is required.\\n\\nBrushes:\\n\\n![pencil_3_large_4b](./brushes/pencil_3_large_4b.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step II - Abstract\\n\\n![concept](./pp01.jpg)\\n\\nThe Next step is to make a simple painting in order to finalize my composition and overall concept.

Which is not as readable as array\\\\[row\\\\]\\\\[column\\\\]. But a vector of vector has performance issues. This article shows an object-oriented way of representing a matrix as a C++ class without losing performance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Table of content\\n\\n* [The Problem](#the-problem)\\n* [Matrix Class](#matrix-class)\\n* [Conclusion](#conclusion)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nMost people, who has to deal with the matrices in C++, would be familiar with this problem.\\n\\nI\'m listing two of the most popular ways for representing matrix. One excels in readability while others in performance.\\n\\n* First way is to use vector of vector.\\n\\n```cpp\\nvector<vector<int>> matrix(rows, vector<int>(cols));\\n// do stuff\\n// access like matrix[y][x]\\n// no need to free. RAII rocks.\\n```\\n\\nThis is similar to using double pointer in C for dynamic 2D array.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint **matrix = new int*[rows];\\nfor(int i = 0; i < rows; i++)\\n    matrix[i] = new int[cols];\\n// do stuff\\n// access like matrix[y][x]\\nfor(int i = 0; i < rows; i++)\\n    delete [] matrix[i];\\ndelete [] matrix;\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s basically an array of arrays. Every element of the outer array points to another array of integers. That\'s why you can reference it two times. But, since every array is separately allocated, to access the array we must have to go to the elements of the outer array first and then inner ones. Also, there will be no guarantee that every row will be adjacent to each other in memory. They can be scattered across the heap.\\n\\n* Second way is to use C style array.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint* matrix = new int[rows*cols];\\n// do stuff\\n// access like matrix[y*cols+x]\\ndelete [] matrix;\\n```\\n\\nThis will make a solid continuous chunk of memory in heap. So, it\'ll have a better access time and pattern.\\n\\n### Performance\\n\\nC style array access should perform better than vector style access. As vector style has to refer two times to access an element, the address of matrix (outer array) can be saved in the register but elements have to come from memory (or cache). The other problem is that at the end of a row next row could be anywhere, and the pre-fetcher can not predict the next fetch.\\n\\nIt\'s hard to measure general performance since the use case varies a lot. But to get some idea I\'m considering two types of algorithms with square and rectangular matrices. All the results are compiler on GCC 7.2 with c++14 and -O3 flags on linux x86 machine.\\nFor simplicity\'s sake, we have a fixed number of rows and columns but it can be easily changed to general inputs.\\n\\n### Sum of all elements\\n\\nLet us take an example of calculating the sum of all the elements in a matrix. Here are our two popular approaches:\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Vector style code for a square matrix\\n// Similar thing can be achieved in C by int**\\nint Vector_sum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int N) {\\n    int sum = 0;\\n    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)\\n        for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)\\n            sum += matrix[i][j];\\n    return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```cpp\\n// C style code for a square matrix\\nint C_style_sum(int* matrix, int N) {\\n    int sum = 0;\\n    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)\\n        for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)\\n            sum += matrix[i * N + j];\\n    return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nResults for a square matrix of size 512*512\\n\\n![sum benchmark](./sum_square_1.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/GXUG06sZDLCrGsOogF5wmd2DOFU)\\n\\nResults for a rectangular matrix of size 1024*256\\n\\n![sum benchmark](./sum_rectangle_1.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/ekNZpPxwiw4wYtqOV51vPF8CXUo)\\n\\nAs you can see the difference is not much. I can live with that for most of the programs. However, transpose yields a completely different story.\\n\\n### Transpose of all elements\\n\\nLet us also take an example of transposing a matrix. Which will have a completely different access pattern then sum. Here are our two popular approaches:\\n\\n```cpp\\n// Vector style code for a square matrix\\n// Similar thing can be achieved in C by int**\\nusing namespace Matrix = vector<vector<int>>;\\nint Vector_transpose(Matrix& matrix1, Matrix& matrix2, int N) {\\n    int sum = 0;\\n    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)\\n        for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)\\n            matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];\\n    return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```cpp\\n// C style code for a square matrix\\nint C_style_transpose(int* matrix1, int* matrix2, int N) {\\n    int sum = 0;\\n    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)\\n        for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)\\n            matrix2[i * N + j] = matrix1[j * N + i];\\n    return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nResults for a square matrix of size 512*512\\n\\n![sum benchmark](./transpose_square_1.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/0DVlD6PAcBQvMmfnjLlJpcSHcls)\\n\\nResults for a rectangular matrix of size 1024*256\\n\\n![sum benchmark](./transpose_rectangle_1.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/IyZq2RwP_RtZJpC4B8iwTSTSRwI)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Matrix Class\\n\\nWe can write a custom template class that will allow us to access elements like vector. To achieve we need to overload the brackets operator.\\n\\n```cpp\\n// e.g. a matrix of 5 rows and 3 cols\\n// matrix<int, 5, 3> x;\\n// can be accessed like x[row][col]\\n\\ntemplate<typename T, size_t R, size_t C>\\nclass matrix {\\n    T* data; // can be changed to unique_ptr in C++1z\\npublic:\\n    matrix() : data(new T[R*C]) {}\\n\\n    ~matrix(){ delete [] data; }\\n\\n    inline T* operator[](int row) {\\n        return &data[row * C];\\n    }\\n\\n    inline const T* operator[](int row) const {\\n        return &data[row * C];\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```\\n\\nAlmost all the compilers today can optimize away the referencing and dereferencing of the same array. The assembly code generated by it is virtually the same as the C style version.\\n\\nSo, how well it performs.\\n\\n### Sum of all elements\\n\\nResults for a square matrix of size 512*512\\n\\n![sum benchmark](./sum_square_2.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/UODm6ylUQGqDCGbdxMIUvpqHrcA)\\n\\nResults for a rectangular matrix of size 1024*256\\n![sum benchmark](./sum_rectangle_2.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/-rGgWT2v0CZsUNbOtoTOCs9ybiE)\\n\\nSeparate code can be found [here](./sum.cpp).\\n\\n### Transpose of all elements\\n\\nResults for a square matrix of size 512*512\\n\\n![sum benchmark](./transpose_square_2.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/VxtU_lR77Fjtm-vo9Vs8CmMDQl4)\\n\\nResults for a rectangular matrix of size 1024*256\\n\\n![sum benchmark](./transpose_rectangle_2.png#invertable)\\nSee this benchmark on [quick-bench](http://quick-bench.com/PXQl8uW3Dk1R_pBelXFlFCMRxEY)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is a good representation of 2D matrices.

Using javascript we can create various animations without relying on the flash or heavy GIF files. Due to security reasons Flash support is decreasing and canvas support is increasing. This article shows how to create matrix style animation.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis is how the end result will looks like:\\n\\n![matrix](matrix.png)\\n\\n[Click here to see live demo with code](https://jsfiddle.net/welcometors/tz38d5vg/1/)\\n\\nFirst we need to create an HTML5 canvas. A HTML5 canvas is used to draw graphics. Almost all of the flash graphics are pretty much replaced by canvas today.\\n\\n```html\\n<canvas id=\\"background\\" width=\\"512\\" height=\\"360\\">\\n</canvas>\\n```\\n\\nThis will be served as an output screen for our animation.\\n\\nNow, we can access the canvas in javascript:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar canvas = document.getElementById(\'background\');\\nvar context = canvas.getContext(\'2d\');\\n```\\n\\n**Canvas object contains the properties related to output window like width, height etc.\\n**Context** object will be used to call in-built functions for drawing, writing etc.\\n\\nLet us assume that our text string is \\"test\\", which is falling vertically in our output screen.\\nAlso, we need multiple instances of it.  \\nLet us assume that the coordinates of the top left corner of a text instance is _x_ and _y_.\\nSee below:\\n\\n![screen](screen.svg#invertable)\\n\\nI encapsulated one of them in a dotted box to showcase the top right coner of a single instance.\\nSince, we don\'t have infinite memory for our infinitely falling matrix text instances. So we need to reuse them.\\nA clever trick is to change the coordinate back to the top when they cross the bottom of the screen.\\n\\n![screenTransition](screenTransition.svg#invertable)\\n\\nThis way, we only need few instances to make our screen look full.\\nTo avoid them form keep falling in the same column we can re-randomize _x_ while changing _y_ to top.  \\n\\nIf you have worked with any graphics library in the past then you will be familiar with the coordinate system of canvas.\\nTop left corner will be _(0,0)_ and _x_ will increase as you go right and _y_ will increase as you go down.\\nWe\'ll be moving our text in range _(x,-screenHeight)_ to _(x,+screenHeight)_ for some randomized _x_.\\n\\nFor moving text we are creating a class (called Bit) to manage them as an individual objects.\\n\\n```javascript\\nfunction Bit (){\\n    // x and y positions are initialized randomly\\n    this.xpos = Math.random() * canvas.width;\\n    this.ypos = Math.random() * 2 * canvas.height - canvas.height;\\n\\n    // this draw the text for current frame\\n    this.draw = function(){\\n        // Formatting the text to display\\n        context.fillStyle = \'green\';\\n        context.font = \'14pt Calibri\';\\n\\n        var text = \\"test\\";\\n        var textWidth = context.measureText(\\"W.\\").width;\\n\\n        // we need to draw the characters of the text\\n        // one by one from top to bottom\\n        for(var i=0;

// drop text by 2 pixels down\\n    };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor testing, we\'ll create some of the **Bit** objects:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar bits = new Array();\\nfor(var i = 0; i < 50; ++i)\\n    bits.push(new Bit());\\n```\\n\\nNow, we need a function to redraw at every frame.\\n\\n```javascript\\nfunction reDraw(){\\n    // before drawing clear entire screen\\n    context.fillStyle = \'black\';\\n    context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\\n\\n    // draw every text elements\\n    for(var bit in bits){\\n        bits[bit].draw();\\n        bits[bit].tick();\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// This will call \'reDraw\' at every 33 milliseconds.\\n// So, our animation will run at 30fps (1000/33 \u2248 30).\\nsetInterval(reDraw, 33);\\n```\\n\\nNow, our code will run like this:\\n\\n![matrix_test](matrix_test.png)\\n\\n[Click here to see live demo with code](https://jsfiddle.net/welcometors/tz38d5vg/0/)\\n\\nMake sure you understood above code completely before moving ahead.\\n* * *\\n\\nNow, we need to add depth (i.e. some text are near and some are far) in our falling matrix.\\nThis can be achieved by changing the text size, falling speed and brightness according to the depth.\\n\\nWe need different colors and bunch of randomized symbols:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar colors = [\'#008800\', \'#00FF00\', \'#55FF55\', \'#BBFFBB\'];\\nvar words = [\\n    \\"\u6628\u5929\\", \\"\u5c0f\u65f6\\", \\"\u949f\u8868\\", \\"\u6f02\u4eae\\", \\"\u5e38\u89c1\\", \\"\u8aaa\u9019\\",\\n    \\"\uc548\ub155\ud558\\", \\"\uadf8\ub798\uc11c\\", \\"\uc548\ub155\ud558\\", \\"\uc2ed\ub2c8\uae4c\\", \\"\u6d17\u624b\u5728\\",\\n    \\"\u7b11\u597d\u73a9\u513f\\", \\"\u4e48\u5e0c\u5947\u7684\\", \\"\ud658\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4\\", \\"\u597d\u5403\u7684\u98df\u7269\\"];\\n```\\n\\nWe need to change our **Bit** class for depth (distance).\\n\\n```javascript\\nfunction Bit (distance){\\n    // size and speed are inversely proportional to distance\\n    this.speed = 160 / distance;\\n    this.fontSize = parseInt(Math.max(8, Math.min(4*this.speed, 20)));\\n\\n    // font and color will be decided accordingly\\n    this.font = this.fontSize.toString() +\'pt Calibri\';\\n    this.color = colors[(this.fontSize-8)/4];\\n\\n    this.xpos = Math.random() * canvas.width;\\n    this.ypos = Math.random() * 2 * canvas.height - canvas.height;\\n    this.text = Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length);\\n\\n    this.draw = function(){\\n        context.fillStyle = this.color;\\n        context.font = this.font;\\n\\n        var text = words[this.text];\\n        var textWidth = context.measureText(\\"W.\\").width;\\n\\n        for(var i=0;

Thus whenever the operating system gains control of the computer, it is in monitor mode. The system always switches to user mode (by setting the mode bit to 1) before passing the control to a user program.\\"\\n>\\n> \\"When a context switch occurs, the kernel saves the context of old process in its PCB and loads the saved context of the new process scheduled to run.\\"\\n>\\n> -- Galvin (Operating System Concepts)\\n\\nAs mode switching is a part of context switching, it\'s definitely less than context switch time.
