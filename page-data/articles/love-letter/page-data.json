(refraction and dispersion). Once\n\"focal length\" brought in to my notice that you\nwere walking and also talking with focus via\nconcave mirror. I did not trust her and look this\nas a gossip. But now I have personally seen\nthat you were appearing to kiss the \"focus\" even\nwhen you were rebaked by convex mirror.\n</pre>\n<pre>\n    I also came to know from \"Outer Surface\" that\nMr. Normal is also trying to be in love with you.\nI can not tolerate all these movements of yours.\nOn seeing this, my heart, which was already\nbeating with a velocity of 186000 miles/second,\nwas accelerated by 32ft/sec/sec.\n</pre>\n<pre>\n           Dear you know, I always think of you.\nIn fact, you are both the in-centre and ex-centre\nof my flow of thoughts. Mr. Conjugate foci told me,\nthat you were going to see Mr. Convex lens and\nembraced his young son Mr. Centre. By God! from \nthe very moment, when Mr. Conjugate foci told \nme this, the centre of gravity of my heart has\nalso been shifted and Mr. Principle of moment\nhas failed to find it out.\n</pre>\n<pre>\n        Is there is no love for me in your\nheart? No! It can never be so! you love\nme! Please do love me and let me know if\nyou love me and that with how many candle\npowers. I want to meet you in F.P.S Park or\nin C.G.S Garden. If you don't reply to this\nletter within 12 hrs, 12 minutes, and 12 seconds,\nI will commit suicide by throwing myself\ninto \"Magnifying glass\" or striking my head\nwith infinitely large velocity, against\n\"Newtons Circle\".
