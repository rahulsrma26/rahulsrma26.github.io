I was going through some of my old stuff and I stumbled upon my grandpa's notebook. He was an engineer that loves physics. He was an avid reader and a poet. In the notebook, he had written many quotes from the great philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. I have also found an amazing letter.

                                             Principal Axis,
                                        Fraunhofer Lines,
                                    Near Solar spectrum,
                                                North Pole.

Loving Miss Ray,
          Yesterday, as I saw you passing by with
your friend in denser medium, my poor heart broke
into pieces ... (refraction and dispersion). Once
"focal length" brought in to my notice that you
were walking and also talking with focus via
concave mirror. I did not trust her and look this
as a gossip. But now I have personally seen
that you were appearing to kiss the "focus" even
when you were rebaked by convex mirror.

    I also came to know from "Outer Surface" that
Mr. Normal is also trying to be in love with you.
I can not tolerate all these movements of yours.
On seeing this, my heart, which was already
beating with a velocity of 186000 miles/second,
was accelerated by 32ft/sec/sec.

           Dear you know, I always think of you.
In fact, you are both the in-centre and ex-centre
of my flow of thoughts. Mr. Conjugate foci told me,
that you were going to see Mr. Convex lens and
embraced his young son Mr. Centre. By God! from 
the very moment, when Mr. Conjugate foci told 
me this, the centre of gravity of my heart has
also been shifted and Mr. Principle of moment
has failed to find it out.

        Is there is no love for me in your
heart? No! It can never be so! you love
me! Please do love me and let me know if
you love me and that with how many candle
powers. I want to meet you in F.P.S Park or
in C.G.S Garden. If you don't reply to this
letter within 12 hrs, 12 minutes, and 12 seconds,
I will commit suicide by throwing myself
into "Magnifying glass" or striking my head
with infinitely large velocity, against
"Newtons Circle". Rest is O.K.

                                   Microscopically Yours.
Date                     Mr. Pole of Concave Mirror.
1st April                                Post Office Box.
Fools' Day                                 Meter Bridge.
