    ## Paradise
    ---
    A file sharing and media streaming solution for local networks. Using this utility you can start a local server on your machine that is visible to other devices like mobile, laptop etc. Which can be used to download/upload files from other machines using that network.

    ## Simple AI
    ---
    This project aims to create a simple yet powerful neural network framework in C++ (using C++17) that can achieve decent results on the MNIST dataset with reasonable running times. The design is inspired by the simplicity of Keras, enabling the creation of straightforward neural networks for tasks like MNIST classification.

   ## Word Connector
    ---
    This is a simple Android app built in Kotlin for memorizing related words, such as a word and its meaning. The app randomly presents either the word or its meaning and asks for the corresponding pair. It also supports importing and exporting the word list.

    ## LFBG
    ---
    ### Linear Frame Buffer Graphics

    A tiny library (using OpenGL) to revive my old DOS based graphics programs. I’ve ported most of the TurboC’s graphics.h to run my TurboC codes. And supporting linear frame buffer to run my VBE (VESA BIOS Extensions) dependent codes.

    ## Checkers
    ---
    A game that is created by me and my friend Prashant for a school project. Initially we made it using TurboC (2005). Now, I’ve ported it to OpenGL using LFBG library.

    Executable for Windows: [checkers.zip](/downloads/checkers.zip)

    ## Turing Machine
    ---
    This is a flash (swf file) simulation of a single tape turing machine that takes a recursively enumerable language and simulates all the steps. Browsers are dropping the flash support day by day. So, you will be needing a [SWF player](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-SWF-Files) to run this.

    ## Retro Cheats
    ---
    This is a simple webapp to download `.cht` file for your favorite game. It uses [libretro-database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database) to fetch the files.

    Webapp: [Retro Cheats](pathname:///cht)

    ## Jinja Resume
    ---
    A resume generation utility using jinja templates with HTML and css. It uses a simple JSON file to store the resume data.

    Example: [resume](https://rahulsrma26.github.io/jinja-resume/)

    ## Phonetic Word Similarity
    ---
    A novel method to compare the phonetic similarity between words based on phonetic features.
