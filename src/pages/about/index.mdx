## Welcome to my page

### I am a DeepLearning Scientist by profession, graphics and system developer by soul and RL enthusiast by heart.

I'm a Scientist who started as a Software Developer at Microsoft. I began
programming at a very young age. My early programs were in C++ for DOS and
in VB6 for Windows 9x. My early projects on DOS include my own graphics
library for VESA SVGA, a ray-tracing engine, a 'wav' music player with
visualizations, a GUI library, and a Checkers game with AI.


As I started doing mini-projects of my own in 2003, I've worked with many
languages and technologies. I have professional experience in C++, Python,
C#, Java, and JavaScript. However, I've also worked with C, Kotlin, Basic,
Assembly (x86), Matlab, and ActionScript for some of my own projects.
Computer graphics and AI are my favorite fields.
Sometimes, I code on HackerRank and Project Euler.

Apart from computers and math, my hobbies are drawing, cycling, reading,
gaming, and watching IMDb top-rated movies, TV shows, and anime.
I enjoy music from almost all genres. Additionally, I'm interested in
painting, playing music, and learning new things.

I've created many projects in the fields of computer graphics, AI,
and system programming. Check my GitHub repositories for more details.
