## Welcome to my page

### I am a DeepLearning Scientist by profession, graphics and system developer by soul and RL enthusiast by heart.

I’m a Scientist who started as a
Software Developer in Microsoft. I started
programming from very young age. My early programs
are in C++ for DOS and in VB6 for Windows 9x. My
early projects on DOS includes my own graphics
library for VESA SVGA, a ray-tracing engine, 'wav'
music player with visualizations, GUI library and
Checkers game with AI.

As I started doing mini-projects of my own from
2003, I’ve worked on many languages and
technologies. I’ve a professional experience in C++,
Python, C#, Java and Javascript. However, I’ve also
worked in C, Kotlin, Basic, Assembly(x86), Matlab
and ActionScript for some of my own projects.
Computer graphics and AI are my favorite fields.
Sometimes, I code on hackerrank and projecteuler.

Apart from computers and maths my hobbies are
drawing, cycling, reading, gaming and watching IMDB
top rated movies, TV shows and anime. I enjoy music
of almost all the genres. Apart from that, I’m
interested in painting, playing music and learning
new things.

I've created many projects in the field of
computer graphics, AI, and system programming.
