## Turing Machine
### (Flash Simulation)

This is a fash (swf file) simulation of a single tape turing machine that takes a recursively enumerable language and simulates all the steps. Browsers are dropping the flash support day by day. So, you will be needing a [SWF player](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-SWF-Files) to run this.
