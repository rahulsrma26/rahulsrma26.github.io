[SimpleNN](https://github.com/rahulsrma26/simpleNN)

A simple and easy to understand implementation of neural network from scratch. Yet it is powerful enough to give decent results in MNIST dataset and optimized enough to run very fast on CPU.

[LFBG](https://github.com/rahulsrma26/lfbg)

A tiny library (using OpenGL) to revive my old DOS based graphics programs. I've ported most of the TurboC's graphics.h to run my TurboC codes. And supporting linear frame buffer to run my VBE (VESA BIOS Extensions) dependent codes.

[WordConnector](https://github.com/rahulsrma26/WordConnector)

Simple android App made in Kotlin to remember word meaning. Randomly fetches either meaning and asks word or show word and ask for meaning.

[Checkers](dnld/checkers.zip)

A game that is created by me and my friend Prashant for a school project.
Initially we made in TurboC. Now, I've ported it to OpenGL using LFBG.
