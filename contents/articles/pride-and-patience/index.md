This painting is inspired from
![original](ref.jpg)

This scene is from one of my favorite saga (android saga) from the show Dragon Ball Z. This is where Vegeta and other Z warriors lose to androids and they just find out that there is an even more powerful villain (cell). Vegeta just goes to the mountains and Trunks follows. Later, Goku arrives and Trunks informs Goku that Vegeta is standing there from last three days. It's a sunny day with clear sky in the show, which in my opinion doesn't suits the mood. So, to bring justice to the scene, I've altered weather and time.

## Step I - Sketch

![sketch](pp00.jpg)

I start most of my paintings with a sketch. It gives me an idea regarding size, proportion, perspective and the space around characters.
This process is easier to perform but lot of thought process and tinkering is required.

## Step II - Abstract

![concept](pp01.jpg)

Next step is to make a simple painting in order to finalize my composition and overall concept. Also, I chose some base colors and base lighting, to convey the story in a better form.

At this stage, I mainly focused on shape and proportions as they will be difficult to amend later. After this stage, the painting is in a good shape.

## Step III - Foreground

![mountain](pp02.jpg)

Apart from background, majority of the area is occupied by the rocks around the characters. I mainly focused on the shades so that extrusions of the rocks become more prominent. Also, added some shadows to Trunks.

## Step IV - Background

![background](pp03.jpg)

Now, I worked on the background. Reshaped the distant mountains. Reshade the clouds, so that they become gloomy and dark. Added a glow to the lightening so that it will be highlighted.

    <img src="brushes/wet_textured_soft.png" alt="wet_textured_soft" style="width:auto; display:inline-block"/>
    <img src="brushes/blender_textured_soft.png" alt="blender_textured_soft" style="width:auto; display:inline-block"/>

</div>

## Step V - Trunks

![trunks](pp04.jpg)

Reshaded Trunks to better mix it with the environment. Also, painted iconic Capsule Corp logo on the jacket. Rescaled Vegeta according to perspective and distance.

</div>

## Step VI - Rain

![rain](pp05.jpg)

Added rain via G'MIC-Qt based on angle that'll suit the scene. To give an apt look of a heavy rain, I've increased the brightness of distant objects and background. Vegeta's pose is changed to his iconic hands fold standing position.

## Step VII - Highlights

![highlights](pp06.jpg)

Corrected Trunks head (being too wide). Specular highlights added to show the effect of wet rocks, shining in the thunder. Added the effect of rain trickling down from rocks.

Now rain drop splashes after hitting Trunks and rocks. Slight brightness and contrast adjusted.
